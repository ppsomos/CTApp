  - "A colony of beavers is travelling through a dark forest. The path is narrow,
    so they travel in a row without passing. Sometimes there is a hole in the path.
    A hole is passed in the following manner: \u2022 First as many beavers jump into
    the hole as fit in. \u2022 The entire colony will then pass across the hole.
    \u2022 The beavers that jumped in will then climb out. Question: A colony of
    7 beavers passed through the forest. They pass over 3 holes. The first hole fits
    4 beavers, the second fits 2, and in the last hole fit 3 beavers. What order
    do the beavers find themselves after they have passed the third hole?"
  Question_Explanation:
  - Let's think about this problem in a more simplified way. So, the employer wants
    to offer 900 euros for all of the workers, and each one of them will get paid
    based on the number of days they have worked (have in mind that all of them work
    for the same pay rate). So, in total, all of them have completed 10 days worth
    of work (2+3+5=10 working days). If we want to find how much each working day
    will cost, we will divide the total amount to be paid with the number of working
    days.That means that each day costs 90 euros (900 euros/10 days = 90 euros).
    Therefore, the 3rd worker, who has worked for 5 days, will get 90x5=450 euros!
  - "This is all about finding the pattern! There are 2 sequences here, which are
    interwined. The first is adding 14 (14, 28, 42, 56, 70,\u2026,) and the second
    is adding 16 (16, 32, 48, 64, 80,\u2026,)"
  - Lets find the pattern here! The pattern is that each number consists of the last
    three digits of the previous one (in first order) plus the first two digits of
    the previous one (in last order). Thus, since the previous number is 67428, the
    missing number will be 42867
  - How are the words doctor and hospital related? The doctor works at the hospital.
    In the same sense, the farmer works at the farm.
  - In this example, the first word is a part of the second word. Just like the tree
    is part of the whole forest, the flower is part of the bouquet!
  - The verbs running and talking indicate a fast pace, while the verbs walking and
    spelling a slower pace.
  - The correct number is 6! That is because each number from the upper row is multiplied
    with its previous integer and the second row is the sum, for example, 7x6=42
  - An arrow can guide us along the flowcharting path.
  - 'So, let''s start by simplifying the question. So, the monkey goes with one jump
    3 feet up but slips down by 2 feet. So in one jump he actually gets to the height
    of 1 foot. So, let''s count how many jumps he will need to reach the top of the
    wall. Counting? Finished? when he reaches 17 feet and when he makes the 18th
    jump of 3 feet, he will reach the top of the wall and will not slip down. If
    you want to use math, the calculation is simple => every jump for the monkey
    is actually 3-2=1 on reaching 3 feet. 20-3=17 feet. He has to jump for 17/1=17
    jumps, on the jump of 18, he will get to the top.  '
  - Try to understand the pattern that each elemnets follow and then check them together.
    What changes? how changes?The circles inside and outside the box switch color
    after each turn. The line movement follows the direction between the two circles,
    with the dot point to the outside circle direction. Considering patterns mentioned,
    after the last box, the white circle should be inside the gray box and the dot
    point should always follow the same direction. So, the only correct answer following
    the sequence is box E. The answer to the question is d.
  - The sum of the sides of all the figures increases with each tile. A circle counts
    as one side. The central shape changes colour with each tile. The correct answer
    is F.
  - 'First, find the two stops mentioned in the question. Once found, keep following
    the dark blue line. One tip is to not miss the stops without the dot.  '
  - 'The weekly pay equals to the multiplication between the pay rates and the total
    worked hours. Keep in mind that the hour pay rate is different atfer 40 hours. '
  - To solve this question, it's better to order the items from the highest to lowest
    price. The order will be 10, 10, 8, 8, 5, 5, 3, 2, 1, 1. So, in this auction,
    you can buy three devices and get the one with the lowest price for free. Try
    to write down scenarios. Start from the first 3, 10 + 10 + 8 (will be free) =
    20, 8 + 5 + 5 (will be free) = 13, ... write down the rest and sum all.
  - The correct answer is either A or C, they are both acceptable. However, C is
    the perfect answer ans it is considering all the possible problems and solutions.
  - The correct answer is D. Answer A is empathetic but does not follow up. Answer
    B is quiestioning the reason behind the problem but nothing more. Answer C is
    inspirational but not empathetic. Answer D is empathetic, inspirational, apologetic
    and looking for the reason
  - The correct answer is B as this is destructive criticism. All the other answers
    are fostering constructive critisim skills.
  - The correct answer is D because it does not contain a basic life support action
    plan.  Defribiliation is basic life support -however - walking away is exactly
    the opposite. In fact, you cannot walk away as it is an omission of support.
  - The answer to choose is C as this is the only incorrect and wrong answer for
    the scenario.  All the other answers are correct.
  - Learning languages is like brewing tea. In order to write/say something according
    to the grammar, you need to know the language guide. Grammar can be compared
    to a cooking recipe, explaining all the steps needed to prepare a dish. But first
    of all, we need to know the ingredients!  The ingredients in language grammar
    are, for example, the subject and the verb.  Dividing sentences into ingredients
    will improve your learning - try it! The same goes for learning how to build
    structures
  - 'If you were to add ten tens, it would be easy. The sum would be 100. This looks
    interesting, so try to start the addition with the last number, that is, 10.
    Add to it the sum of the first and the second-to-last, that is, 1 + 9 and proceed
    like this. The addition would then look like this:  10 + 1 + 9 + 2 + 8 + 3 +
    7 + 4 + 6.  You have five rows and in each the sum is 10. You have thus decomposed
    a complex arithmetic operation into a series of simple components. Five tens,
    is 50, and 50, is half of 100. That is, 100 / 2. You are left with 5 more to
    add. All together, it is 100 / 2 + 5, or 55. Can you see the pattern now that
    will simplify the calculations? Now check if 55 is a good result by adding all
    the numbers from 1 to 10 one by one. '
  - If you add up the first and last number you have to add, which is 1 + 20, you
    get 21. You have 10 such pairs. These are the building blocks you discovered
    by decomposing a complex computation. So 10 x 21 = 210. This is the pattern for
    such calculations. Now check if 210 is a good result by adding all the numbers
    from 1 to 20 one by one on a piece of paper, in a calculator or on a computer.
    You can also try in memory :)
  - 'The rationale behind the given sequence of steps to draw a green square 150px
    x 150px is based on the principles of computational thinking.   Computational
    thinking is a problem-solving approach that involves breaking down a complex
    problem into smaller, more manageable parts, and then systematically analyzing
    and solving each part. It involves a series of steps, such as problem decomposition,
    pattern recognition, abstraction, algorithm design, and evaluation.   In this
    case, the problem is to draw a green square of size 150px x 150px. To solve this
    problem using computational thinking, we can break it down into smaller steps
    and design an algorithm to perform those steps in a specific order.   The given
    sequence of steps follows the following rationale:  a) Go to the starting place:
    This step ensures that the program starts drawing the square from the desired
    position on the canvas. Without this step, the square may be drawn in an unintended
    location on the canvas.  b) Set the color of the pen to green: This step sets
    the color of the pen to green, which will be used to draw the square. Without
    this step, the pen may use a different color, which will not result in a green
    square.  c) Move 150px: This step moves the pen 150px in a straight line, which
    will form one side of the square. This step is repeated three times in total
    to draw all four sides of the square.  d) Rotate clockwise 90 degrees: This step
    rotates the pen 90 degrees clockwise, which will orient the pen to draw the next
    side of the square at a right angle to the previous side. Without this step,
    the pen would draw the next side in the same direction as the previous side,
    resulting in a rectangle instead of a square.  e) Repeat the above two steps
    3 times: This step repeats the previous two steps (move 150px and rotate 90 degrees)
    three times to draw all four sides of the square. Without this step, the program
    would only draw one side of the square, leaving it incomplete.  Therefore, the
    given sequence of steps is essential to draw a green square of size 150px x 150px
    in the intended location and orientation.'
  - 'To reach the upper right corner on a 5x5 board starting from the central square
    position, the knight should move in a particular sequence of moves. The optimal
    moves to take are:  1. Move 2 squares down and 1 square right. 2. Move 2 squares
    left and 1 square up. 3. Move 2 squares up and 1 square right. 4. Move 2 squares
    right and 1 square up. OR 1. Move 2 squares up and 1 square right. 2. Move 2
    squares down and 1 square right. 3. Move 2 squares left and 1 square up. 4. Move
    2 squares right and 1 square up.  There are a couple of reasons why these moves
    are the optimal solution to reach the upper right corner from the central square
    position.  First, the initial move of 2 squares down and 1 square right (or 2
    squares up and 1 square right) is the most efficient move to get the knight closer
    to the corner. It moves the knight 2 squares towards the corner while maintaining
    its position on the board.  Next, the sequence of moves that follow are designed
    to get the knight as close to the upper right corner as possible. By moving 2
    squares left and 1 square up, the knight moves closer to the upper edge of the
    board. The subsequent move of 2 squares up and 1 square right moves the knight
    closer to the corner once again. Finally, the move of 2 squares right and 1 square
    up gets the knight to the upper right corner.  This sequence of moves ensures
    that the knight always moves towards the corner while remaining on the board.
    By using these optimal moves, the knight can reach the upper right corner in
    the shortest number of moves possible from the central square position.  Overall,
    the optimal sequence of moves to reach the upper right corner on a 5x5 board
    starting from the central square position involves careful planning and consideration
    of the knight''s movement rules. By analyzing the possible moves and evaluating
    their efficiency, we can determine the optimal solution to the problem.  This
    sequence of moves ensures that the knight always moves towards the corner while
    remaining on the board. By using these optimal moves, the knight can reach the
    upper right corner in the shortest number of moves possible from the central
    square position.  Overall, the optimal sequence of moves to reach the upper right
    corner on a 5x5 board starting from the central square position involves careful
    planning and consideration of the knight''s movement rules. By analyzing the
    possible moves and evaluating their efficiency, we can determine the optimal
    solution to the problem.  From a computational thinking perspective, finding
    the optimal sequence of moves for a knight to reach the upper right corner of
    a 5x5 board starting from the central square position involves several important
    computational thinking concepts:      Decomposition: To solve the problem, we
    need to decompose it into smaller sub-problems. Specifically, we need to identify
    the possible moves that a knight can make and evaluate each move''s efficiency
    in terms of getting the knight closer to the target location.      Pattern recognition:
    We can apply pattern recognition skills to identify the moves that are most efficient
    for the knight to reach the upper right corner. Specifically, we can recognize
    that the moves that involve moving 2 squares down and 1 square right or 2 squares
    up and 1 square right are the most efficient because they move the knight towards
    the target location while also maintaining the knight''s position on the board.     
    Abstraction: We can abstract the problem by treating the chessboard as a 5x5
    grid of cells and the knight''s moves as a set of rules that dictate how the
    knight can move between cells. This abstraction allows us to simplify the problem
    and focus on the essential elements necessary to solve it.      Algorithmic thinking:
    To find the optimal sequence of moves for the knight to reach the upper right
    corner, we need to develop a systematic and repeatable approach. Specifically,
    we need to evaluate each of the eight possible moves the knight can make and
    choose the moves that move the knight towards the target location while also
    keeping the knight on the board.      Evaluation: Finally, we need to apply logical
    reasoning skills to evaluate each move''s efficiency and choose the best moves
    for the knight to make. This involves understanding the rules for how the knight
    can move on the board, identifying the goal of the problem, and using evaluation
    to determine the optimal solution.  Overall, the problem of finding the optimal
    sequence of moves for a knight to reach the upper right corner of a 5x5 board
    starting from the central square position involves applying several key computational
    thinking concepts and skills, including decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction,
    algorithmic thinking, and evaluation. By applying these skills, we can determine
    the most efficient sequence of moves for the knight to reach its destination.'
  - "Step 1: Decomposition To solve the problem, we need to break it down into smaller
    parts. We need to determine the order in which the beavers will come out of the
    third hole. To do this, we need to analyze each hole and how it affects the order
    of the beavers.  Step 2: Pattern Recognition We need to look for patterns in
    the way the beavers pass the holes. For each hole, the beavers that jump in will
    come out last. The beavers that pass the hole before the ones that jump in will
    come out first, followed by the ones that jump in. The beavers that pass the
    hole after the ones that jump in will be first.  Step 3: Abstraction We need
    to abstract the information we have gathered and keep track of the order of the
    beavers after passing each hole based on the number of beavers that jump in and
    the order of the beavers before and after each hole.  Let's abstract the idea
    of solution. General steps of abstraction can be noted as follows:      We need
    to keep track of the order of the beavers after passing each hole.     For each
    hole, we need to determine which beavers jump in and which ones pass the hole.    
    We need to determine the order of the beavers that pass the hole before and after
    the ones that jump in.  Step 4: Algorithm design Based on the information in
    the problem, we can determine the order of the beavers after passing the third
    hole. We can start by looking at the order of the beavers before passing the
    first hole. Since 4 beavers jump into the first hole, the first four beavers
    in the original order will be the last ones to come out of the first hole. We
    also have to remember about reversing the orger of beavers leaving the hole.
    Repeating this steps for each hole will provide the solution.   Let's check the
    algorithm:   Initially the line is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Then after the first hole of
    depth 4 we have: 5 6 7 4 3 2 1 After the second hole (depth 2) we have: 7 4 3
    2 1 6 5 After the third hole (depth 3) we get: 2 1 6 5 3 4 7 Organising data
    in a structured way is important in computer science and there are many different
    data structures that can be used for this purpose. This task shows an example
    of a structure called a stack, which works similarly to stacking plates on top
    of each other. You always add new plates on top of the stack and have to remove
    them from the top one at a time. This type of structure is commonly referred
    to as a LIFO-structure \u2013 the objects that have been added last are the first
    to be removed. (LIFO = Last In First Out). "
