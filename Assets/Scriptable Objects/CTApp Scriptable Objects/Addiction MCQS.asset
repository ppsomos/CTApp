  Question_Explanation:
  - Computational thinking is all about breaking down decisions into smaller steps
    in order to be more manageable. This can also be applied to deciding how and
    when you are going to travel. First, you need to identify when you want to travel,
    based on your avaliability. After that, you need to search for all the different
    options that you might have. For example, you might want to consider travelling
    by car, train, or even plane. You can also search for more affordable options,
    for example adding a layover flight. The next step is to compare all this information
    and think of any other possible solution that will fit your requirements, for
    example travelling to the country by plane but returning by train if you're going
    to save some time. Since you now have all the information that you need and you
    have created multiple scenarios, you can choose the one that fits you best!
  - Between all the information that the advert could have provided, the date of
    the tour is the most relevant one!
  - When deciding to do something or solve a problem it is really important to think
    through the steps! In this example, the first thing that you need to do is to
    research your pilot training options, then to pass all the necessary medical
    exams that they will propose, take the piloting lessons and, at last, give your
    exams to get your certification.
  - Computational thinking is really valuable and can facilitate us in solving problems,
    communicating and cooperating with others and managing life better!
  - 'Let''s simplify this problem! The first row consists of 5 bricks. The second
    of 5+4=9 bricks, and so on. In order to calculate the 15th row, you can first
    calculate the 14 rows besides the first one, by just multiplying 14 rows x 4
    new bricks. Adding the first one as well, the 15th line consists of 5 + (4x14)
    = 61 bricks. '
  - Let's think this through! So the A team has 35 students, meaning that 90 - 35
    = 55 students who belong to either team B or team C. The B team has 15 more students
    than C team, so from the total of 55 students who belong to one of the two teams,
    we know that at least 15 belong to team B, so 55 - 15 = 40 students are equally
    divided into the two teams. Therefore the B team has 40/2 = 20, 20 + 15 = 35
    students, and the C team has 40/2 = 20 students!
  - 'If we would like to choose one of the words that fits the least with the others,
    we would remove the word "December" since September, October and November are
    all the months of autumn, while December is one of the winter months. '
  - 'Think about the priority level in math. What should be calculated first? How
    to find the value of x? Start with the first questions and then continue with
    including all the x-factors on one side of the equation and the rest on the other
    side. Then start the decomposition process. '
  - Think about the pattern and space between the alphabet. It started from A and
    got to E. How many letters were skipped? Count it. Then, check how many letters
    were skipped between E to I and how many from I to M? Is the number the same?
    Now apply the number you figured to answer the ? (quation mark)
  - Use multiplication to distribute the portion in the brackets and subtract which
    share the same variables.
  - Thinking from a customer perspective and keep in mind that the payment step should
    always be the last.
  - The big black and white squares switch colors after each tile. The small red
    and white squares switch colors after each tile. The small stile with red squares
    moves clockwise from corners to middles of each side.
  - This question is so simple. If you remember all along the process what you are
    unloading, you will find the answer. If you don't have it, you can't move on
    with the whole process. It's so simple. Did you figure it? Yes, indeed. There
    should be container on the ship be to unloaded before the process starts.
  - To solve this question, it's better to order the items from the lowest to highest
    weight. The order will be 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Count the numbers
    with a total of 30. How many scenarios did you have? Since it says the maximum
    number of items, it means that you should better start with summing items with
    lower weights and reach 30. 2+3+3+4+5+6+7=30 (7 items) check if you can find
    another scenario with 8 items.
  - The correct answer is either C or D, they are both acceptable. However, D is
    the perfect answer.
  - 'The correct answer is B. Without knowing the maximum that you can spend to buy
    the discount card you cannot select anything else. '
  - 'The perfect answer is B. However, all the other answers are correct for the
    purpose of baking. '
  - The correct answer is D as this sentence does not help you developing a board
    game but rather judge the game. All the other sentences are helping you thinking
    about th next steps to develop a board game.
  - 'The corect answer is D. The answer C is not correct because the rude behavior
    of another person should not impact on your good behaviour and moral choices. 
    The answer B is not correct because you are not showing altruism and you could
    have used those money for a different cause. The answer A is not correct because
    you demonstrate selfshness and judgemental character by knowing who dropped the
    money and not giving them back.  '
  - The correct answer is C. Going everywhere, every time, without a speciic purpose
    might not be the best choice for time management. Also you lack on prioritisation
    skills (what event is important and what is not), however, is good for networking.
    All the other answers will help you.
  - 'The correct answer is B as the skills listed are all soft skills. The other
    answers cointains at least one hard skills: The answer A contains Electrical
    work, the answer C  cointains coding, the answer D contains engineering.'
  - The correct answer is D as board games are not considered as essetial in a survival
    scenario.  All the other answers cointains items that are essential modern survival
    items.
  - The most logical and efficient answer is B. Answer A is suitable, but you will
    be late for your exam. Answer C is more expensive and possibly dangerous, and
    does not guarantee you will be on time, as there is no schedule or time you can
    follow. Answer D will make you miss the exam completely.
  - 'Computational thinking involves breaking down complex problems into smaller,
    more manageable parts, and using a logical approach to solve them. This same
    approach can be applied to resisting unwanted pressure to do the wrong thing. 
    The steps of naming the elements of the situation, recognizing the risky context,
    applying assertiveness rights, and leaving the place/situation are based on a
    systematic approach to problem-solving, and each step builds on the previous
    one.  Here is how these steps apply to resisting unwanted pressure:      Naming
    elements of the situation: The first step in resisting unwanted pressure is to
    identify and understand the different elements of the situation. This includes
    understanding the motives of the person or people pressuring you, the potential
    consequences of giving in to their demands, and the ethical implications of your
    actions.      Recognizing risky context: Once you have identified the different
    elements of the situation, the next step is to recognize when the context becomes
    risky. This includes understanding when the pressure being applied is inappropriate
    or unethical, and when it may lead to harm or negative consequences for you or
    others.      Applying assertiveness rights: After recognizing that the context
    has become risky, the next step is to assert your rights and stand up for yourself.
    This involves clearly communicating your boundaries and expectations to the person
    or people pressuring you, and refusing to give in to their demands.      Leaving
    the place/situation: If the pressure continues and you are unable to resolve
    the situation, the final step is to leave the place or situation. This may involve
    physically removing yourself from the situation, seeking help from others, or
    taking other steps to ensure your safety and well-being.  By following these
    steps in order, you can approach the problem of unwanted pressure in a logical
    and systematic way, and increase your chances of successfully resisting it. '
  - 'Computational thinking involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more
    manageable parts, and using a logical approach to solve them. This same approach
    can be applied to teaching a robot how to clean a room.  The steps of listing
    all elements of the room, recognizing areas linking elements, defining rules
    to be applied, and preparing step-by-step instructions are based on a systematic
    approach to problem-solving, and each step builds on the previous one.  Here''s
    how these steps apply to teaching a robot how to clean a room:      List all
    elements of the room: The first step in teaching a robot how to clean a room
    is to list all the elements of the room that the robot needs to interact with.
    This includes furniture, walls, floors, and any other objects or features that
    may be present.      Recognize areas linking elements: Once you have identified
    all the elements of the room, the next step is to recognize the areas that link
    these elements together. For example, the area between the walls and the floor,
    or the area under furniture. By recognizing these areas, you can develop a more
    efficient cleaning strategy for the robot.      Define rules to be applied: After
    recognizing the areas linking the elements, the next step is to define the rules
    that the robot should follow when cleaning the room. For example, the robot may
    need to avoid bumping into furniture or walls, or it may need to clean certain
    areas more thoroughly than others.      Prepare step-by-step instructions: Once
    the rules have been defined, the final step is to prepare step-by-step instructions
    that the robot can follow to clean the room efficiently. These instructions should
    take into account the elements of the room, the areas linking them, and the rules
    that have been defined.  By following these steps in order, you can approach
    the task of teaching a robot how to clean a room in a logical and systematic
    way, and increase the chances of the robot performing the task efficiently and
    effectively.'
  - 'Computational thinking involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more
    manageable parts and developing a logical approach to solving problems. This
    same approach can be applied to creating a to-do list for cleaning a room.  Including
    a list of all items to be cleaned, a rule combining categories of items in the
    room into groups/types, and general recommendations for the order and thoroughness
    of cleaning groups/types of items, helps to establish a clear and organized plan
    for cleaning the room. By breaking down the cleaning process into smaller parts,
    it becomes easier to manage and complete the task efficiently.  Additionally,
    providing specific instructions for cleaning groups and items, such as furniture,
    electronics, and other items in the correct order, ensures that the cleaning
    process is carried out thoroughly and consistently. This approach also helps
    to minimize the likelihood of missing any items or areas during the cleaning
    process. '
  - 'The computational thinking model involves breaking down a problem into smaller,
    more manageable parts, and designing solutions that use algorithms and data structures.
    Applying this model to the process of writing an online shopping program, the
    following rationale can be provided for the order of the tasks:  Step 1 - Search
    for an item: The first step in any online shopping program is to allow the user
    to search for items they want to purchase. This involves providing a search box
    or a list of categories to browse through, and then using algorithms to search
    through a database of products to find the ones that match the user''s search
    criteria.  Step 2 - Add the item to the shopping cart: Once the user has found
    an item they want to purchase, the next step is to add it to the shopping cart.
    This involves creating a data structure that can store the item''s details, such
    as its name, price, and quantity, and then adding it to the user''s cart. The
    shopping cart can also keep track of the user''s total cost and display it for
    them. You cannot add the item to the cart not knowing if the product is in the
    database (step 1).   Step 3 - Enter the delivery address: After the user has
    added all the items they want to purchase to their shopping cart, the next step
    is to enter their delivery address. This involves providing a form where the
    user can enter their name, address, phone number, and other relevant details.
    This information can be stored in a database or sent to a third-party service
    for verification. It is necessary to know the number and the size / weight of
    all items purchased (step 2) to assess the proper form and the price of the delivery.  
    Step 4 - Pay for the item: Finally, once the user has entered their delivery
    address, the last step is to allow them to pay for the item. This involves integrating
    with a payment gateway, such as PayPal or Stripe, to process the user''s payment.
    The program should also provide a confirmation page that shows the user their
    order details, the delivery address, and the total cost. It is necessary to know
    all items ordered and the distance of delivery to know the To calculate the total
    price you need to know all items selected, the form and the distance of delivery
    (steps 1 - 3) before asking for payment.  Overall, following this sequence of
    tasks in the program ensures that the user can search, select, and purchase the
    items they want in a smooth and logical way, while also providing the necessary
    data structures and algorithms to make the program function efficiently.'
  - 'From a computational thinking perspective, following the steps in the order
    given when preparing a cake recipe is essential to ensuring a good outcome. Here''s
    why:  1. Decomposition: The first step in preparing a cake recipe is to break
    down the task into smaller subtasks. This includes listing all the ingredients,
    describing how they should be combined for each ingredient, explaining possible
    modifications to the recipe, and describing all the steps needed to make the
    cake. This decomposition allows us to better understand the problem and focus
    on each individual task.  2. Pattern recognition: Once we have decomposed the
    task, we can identify patterns in the recipe. For example, we might notice that
    the recipe starts with listing the ingredients, then moves on to describing how
    they should be combined, followed by possible modifications to the recipe, and
    finally the steps needed to make the cake. Recognizing these patterns helps us
    to understand the flow of the recipe and the dependencies between the different
    steps.  3. Abstraction: After identifying the patterns in the recipe, we can
    abstract away the details of each step and focus on the high-level concepts.
    This means we can think about the recipe in terms of the overall process rather
    than getting bogged down in individual ingredients or measurements.  4. Algorithm
    design: With the high-level concepts in mind, we can design an algorithm for
    preparing the cake recipe. This algorithm should follow the steps in the order
    given, starting with listing the ingredients, then describing how they should
    be combined for each ingredient, followed by explaining possible modifications
    to the recipe, and finally describing all the steps needed to make the cake.
    Following the steps in order ensures that we don''t miss any important steps
    and that the cake turns out as expected.  5. Testing: Finally, we can test the
    recipe by following the algorithm we''ve designed and making modifications as
    needed. Testing helps us to identify any errors in the recipe and refine the
    algorithm for future use.  Overall, following the steps in order when preparing
    a cake recipe is important because it ensures that all the necessary ingredients
    are included and that the recipe is executed correctly. By breaking the recipe
    down into smaller subtasks, recognizing patterns, abstracting away details, designing
    an algorithm, and testing the recipe, we can ensure that the cake turns out delicious
    every time.'
