    Each time, the computer responds with the number of correct digits, which appear
    both in the guess and in the password. Also, it tells the player whether they

  Question_Explanation:
  - 'There is a pattern here! Try to subtract the smaller number from the larger
    one in each part of the bigger circle. Multiply what you get with 3 and you will
    find the number in the corresponding part of the smaller circle. For example,
    for the two upper parts of the bigger circle: 12-8=4, 4x3=12 and 14-10=4, 4x3=12 '
  - 'Definitely eye colour! All the other information can be quite useful for the
    teachers and the headmaster at some point. '
  - 'Look at the columns and rows. Try to see if you can find a pattern. Keep in
    mind that in these types of questions, the column or row with ? (question mark)
    will almost always present the result of the other columns and rows. With this
    in mind, try to use a mathematical approach. Start with simple math. Sum the
    1st and 3rd columns and divide them by 2nd. Do you see a pattern? Do you have
    any results? It''s all about pattern recognition and finding the right pattern
    through math. If the summation doesn''t work, continue by minusing, subtracting,
    multiplying or etc. For this case, we use minus. This is the pattern it follows:
    (1st column - 3rd column)/divide by 2nd column = X+ surplus. Surplus increases
    from 0 to up. Can you figure it out?'
  - 'This question also needs your attention to the recognition of the pattern. These
    three robots follow the same direction. They follow the same order. So, as in
    the example mentioned in the question, try to simplify it by considering, N is
    up, S is down, E is right and W is left. So the order of N, N, S, S, E is up,
    up, down, down, right. Got it? Now, let''s see, the question says Robot A should
    take Sphere, Robot B should take the ring and Robot C should take the cone, so
    what would be the best pattern for all of them to follow? Check the closest sphere
    to A, closest ring to B and closest cone to C. Write down the pattern you think
    is best for each of them. Remember that they all follow the same order and move
    in the same direction. Try to adopt your order thinking about this. Also, remember
    that not always possible to get to the closest object. Haven''t figured it out
    yet? One more tip, check the answers. Try to apply each answer to each robot.
    See which answer can be applied to all. '
  - Try to understand the pattern that each elemnets follow and then check them together.
    What changes? how changes? What is the direction that it goes? The blue circle
    moves in the direction the clock hand points, the number the hand points to is
    the number of blocks it moves.
  - 'n is the number of heart cards you have flipped and also the number of cards
    will be discarded. It equals to 0 for the start. -> n = 0 When the card is in
    the deck, you flip it -> while there are cards in the deck:     flip card If
    the card is a heart for the 1st time, the number of flipped heart cards now is
    1. You discard 1 card. -> If card is a heart:     n = n + 1 If the card is a
    heart for the 2nd time, the number of heart cards will be 1+1. You discard 2
    cards. -> repeat n times:     discard card You repeat the process again by flipping
    the rest of the deck. -> flip card'
  - The correct answer is A.  Aswers C and D are wrong because you NEVER add salt
    if the food is too sweet; Answer B is wrong because you do not add sugar if the
    food is salty.
  - The correct answer is C as this answer explain what a tracker is but does not
    help you create a coping skills tracker for anxiety and stress.  All the other
    answers are sentences that can be implemented in the coping skills tracker.
  - Answers A, B ,or D could be correct, but A is the ideal answer. By considering
    first the items you already have, and then deciding if they are appropriate for
    the event, you are breaking down the challenge into smaller, easier steps
  - 'For starters, an example. Adding numbers from 1 to 10, that is, to X = 10, is
    easy at first. 1 + 2 is just 3, and 3 + 3 is 6, etc. But imagine adding from
    1 to 140. As you add more and more numbers in your mind, it''s easy to get confused.
    Try to find a general solution by changing the way you think. Add, for example,
    not the first and second numbers, but the first and last. 1 + 10 = 11. The next
    pair gives the same result: 2 + 9 = 11. You have decomposed the data into simple,
    repeatable elements. In subsequent pairs, the sum will also be 11. So you have
    recognized the pattern of easy summation. How many pairs will have the same sum?
    The next pairs are: 1+10, 2+9, 3+8, 4+7 and 5+6. The number of pairs is 5, which
    is half of the numbers you have to sum. You can write it so that with 10 numbers
    there is 10 / 2 = 5 - five pairs. You can now abstract the idea using aritmetic
    symbols and arrange an algorithm, describing steps of the solution for any data.
    With X numbers, you have X / 2 pairs, and the summing values are 1 + X. So the
    algorithm looks like this: X/2+(1+X). Now check if this algorithm also gives
    correct results for numbers from 1 to 11, to 20, or for any other number. Also,
    try to generalize this algorithm to any pair of numbers <X; Y> where X<Y.'
  - 'The desired outcome is to fully charge three cell phones using two chargers
    in the shortest time possible.  We can first note that if we try to charge all
    3 cell phones simultaneously using 2 chargers, the charging time will be longer
    than 2 hours for each phone. This is because the power being supplied by the
    chargers will be divided among the 3 phones, so each phone will receive less
    than the full charging power it needs.  Instead, we can charge 2 of the cell
    phones using both chargers simultaneously, and then charge the third phone separately
    once one of the first 2 phones is fully charged. This way, we can get two phones
    charging at the full charging power for 2 hours, which will fully charge them.
    Then, we can use one of the chargers to charge the third phone for 2 hours until
    it is fully charged.  So, the total charging time for all 3 phones will be 2
    hours for the first two phones + 2 hours for the third phone = 4 hours.  The
    above method is also not the fastest one. We can compare the presented solution
    and explanation to other possible answers found as a result of computational
    thinking. The first step of computational thinking is the problem decomposition,
    one of computational thinking steps. The problem decomposition  involves breaking
    down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems that can be
    solved individually and then combined to solve the larger problem.   We can decompose
    the general problem of charging 3 phones with 2 chargers into four simpler sub-problems:
    charging two phones for 2 hours with two chargers, charging one phone for 2 hours
    with one charger, charging one phone for 1 hour with one charger and switching
    one phone from one charger to another.  Now, using these sub-problems and combining
    the extracted variants in a new way, we can see that we can start by charging
    the first phone for 2 hours with the first charger. At the same time, we can
    start charging the second phone with the second charger, but disconnect it after
    1 hour and connect the third phone to the second charger for 2 hours. Once the
    first phone has been fully charged with the first charger, we can in turn connect
    the second phone to this charger for 1 hour. In this way, it will take a total
    of 3 hours to fully charge all three phones using the two chargers.  This is
    the shortest possible time because we are using two chargers simultaneously and
    optimising the charging time for each phone. If we were to charge all three phones
    for 2 hours using one charger, it would take a total of 6 hours to fully charge
    all three phones. Therefore, the solution of charging one phone for 1 hour and
    then switching to the other charger while charging the other two phones for 2
    hours is the most efficient approach, which is the benefit of using computational
    thinking.'
  - 'The error in the program is that it will draw four times the sides of the square,
    but as a one stright line and it will not complete the square by connecting the
    last side to the first side. Instead, the program will end up turning the pen
    90 degrees to the right after drawing the fourth side, but without moving the
    pen to the starting point of the square. Therefore, the final drawing will be
    a "I" shape instead of a square.  The error is due to the fact that the 90-degree
    clockwise rotation command is outside the loop.   To correct the program, the
    90-degree clockwise rotation command should be inside the loop, what takes the
    pen to the starting point of the square. Specifically, the program should be
    modified to set the block in parentheses as [move 100px, turn right 90 degrees]
    before repeating the block again. This way, after drawing each side of the square,
    the pen turn right and finally will move to the starting point of the square,
    and the drawing will be a complete square. The corrected program would be:  repeat
    4 times: [move 100px, turn right 90 degrees]  The correction of the program mistake
    is an example of applying computational thinking principles to a programming
    task. Specifically, the correction involves the use of algorithmic thinking and
    debugging to identify and solve a logical error in the program.  The algorithmic
    thinking process involves breaking down the program into a sequence of steps
    and analyzing how those steps will produce the desired output. By doing this,
    it becomes clear that the original program will draw four sides of a square as
    a single, stright line and fail to complete the square by connecting the last
    side to the first side.  The debugging process involves identifying the error
    in the program''s logic and then modifying the program to correct the error.
    In this case, the error is identified as the placing turn right 90 degrees command
    outside the loop not taking the pen back to the starting point of the square.
    The corrected program is then modified by moving the turn right 90 degrees command
    inside the loop to complete the square.  Overall, this correction demonstrates
    the importance of algorithmic thinking and debugging in programming tasks. By
    applying these computational thinking principles, programmers can identify and
    solve errors in their programs to produce the desired output.'
  - 'To find the least number of moves for a knight to get to one of the corners
    of a 5x5 chessboard from the middle field, we can use a search algorithm such
    as breadth-first search or Dijkstra''s algorithm. However, because the search
    space is relatively small, we can also solve this problem manually by analyzing
    the possible moves.  First, we can observe that there are only eight possible
    moves that the knight can make from the central square:  1. Move 2 squares down
    and 1 square right 2. Move 2 squares down and 1 square left 3. Move 2 squares
    up and 1 square right 4. Move 2 squares up and 1 square left 5. Move 2 squares
    left and 1 square down 6. Move 2 squares left and 1 square up 7 Move 2 squares
    right and 1 square down 8. Move 2 squares right and 1 square up  By making any
    of these eight moves, the knight will be on the field next to one of the corners
    of the board. Therefore, the minimum number of moves required for the knight
    to reach one of the corners is four. This is because the knight must make at
    least three moves in order to reach the field next to which it is located or
    the mirrored field.  For example, suppose the knight starts on the central square
    and wants to reach the upper right corner. The optimal sequence of moves would
    be:  1. Move 2 squares down and 1 square right. 2. Move 2 squares left and 1
    square up. 3. Move 2 squares up and 1 square right. 4. Move 2 squares right and
    1 square up. OR 1. Move 2 squares up and 1 square right. 2. Move 2 squares down
    and 1 square right. 3. Move 2 squares left and 1 square up. 4. Move 2 squares
    right and 1 square up.  Overall, this sequence of moves takes the knight to the
    upper right corner of the board in just four moves, which is the minimum number
    of moves required.  From a computational thinking perspective, solving the problem
    of finding the least number of moves for a knight to get to one of the corners
    of a 5x5 chessboard starting from the central square can be broken down into
    a series of steps:  1. Define the problem: The problem is to find the shortest
    path that a knight can take to reach one of the corners of a 5x5 chessboard starting
    from the central square, given that the knight must move in an L-shaped pattern. 
    2. Analyze the problem: The first step in analyzing the problem is to understand
    the constraints. In this case, the knight must move in an L-shaped pattern, which
    means that it can move two squares in one direction and then one square in a
    perpendicular direction. The chessboard is a 5x5 grid, which means there are
    25 squares. The starting position is the central square, which is at the intersection
    of the third row and the third column.  3. Design a solution: To design a solution,
    we can use a search algorithm to explore all possible paths that the knight can
    take to reach one of the corners of the chessboard. A common search algorithm
    used for problems like this is called breadth-first search (BFS). BFS starts
    at the starting position and explores all possible moves from that position.
    Then it moves to the next level of the search tree and explores all possible
    moves from those positions. This process continues until the solution is found. 
    4. Implement the solution: The implementation of the solution involves writing
    code to perform a BFS search on the chessboard. The algorithm should keep track
    of the shortest path found so far and stop searching when a path to one of the
    corners is found.  5. Test the solution: To test the solution, we can run the
    code on different test cases, such as starting from different positions on the
    chessboard or changing the size of the chessboard. We should also test the solution
    on edge cases, such as when the starting position is already in a corner of the
    chessboard.  From this perspective, it is clear that the minimum number of moves
    required for the knight to reach one of the corners of the 5x5 chessboard starting
    from the central square is 4. This can be proven by analyzing all possible moves
    the knight can make and finding the shortest path to a corner.'
  - Stereoscopic vision is the ability of our eyes to see the same object from slightly
    different perspectives, due to their slightly different positions on our face.
    Our brain then combines these two images to create a three-dimensional perception
    of the object.   A stereographic image takes advantage of this natural phenomenon
    by presenting two slightly different images side by side. When viewed correctly,
    our brain combines these two images to create the illusion of a three-dimensional
    image.  The steps mentioned in the question are a training method for our eyes
    and brain to see the 3D image in stereogram.   From a computational thinking
    perspective, we can think of these steps as a process of training our visual
    perception system to process a stereographic image. This process involves a series
    of steps that allow us to overcome natural cognitive biases and adapt our visual
    perception system to create the illusion of a 3D image.  A computational thinking
    approach involves breaking down a problem into a series of smaller steps and
    algorithms that can be performed in a logical order. In the case of viewing a
    stereogram, the steps listed in the question help us train our visual perception
    system.  The first step, relaxing the eyes, can be seen as decomposition, overcoming
    the natural tendency to focus on one point. By relaxing the eyes, we are able
    to see images in a stereogram that we did not see before, without focusing on
    any of them.  The second step, looking beyond the image, can be seen as overcoming
    the natural cognitive tendency to focus on objects in our field of vision. By
    looking beyond the image, we are able to encompass both images in a stereogram
    without focusing on either of them. It is when we look beyond the image that
    we usually perceive the image hidden in the stereogram, which can be referred
    to as pattern recognition.   The third step, moving the stereogram/head away,
    can be seen as an adjustment of our visual perception system to the two images
    in the stereogram. By moving the stereogram/head away, we are able to adjust
    our visual perspective so that the two images are correctly aligned. Seeing the
    newly recognised spatial image, we perceive its three-dimensional background
    and abstract - understand the general principle and procedure of stereoscopic
    vision.   The fourth step, zooming in and out of the stereogram, can be seen
    as a refinement of the algorithm for aligning the two images for depth perception.
    By zooming in or out from the stereogram, we are able to adjust the distance
    between our eyes and the image, which affects the perceived depth.  Overall,
    the steps mentioned in the question can be considered as an algorithm for training
    our visual perception system to process a stereographic image. By following these
    steps, we are able to overcome natural cognitive biases and adapt our visual
    perception system to create the illusion of a 3D image.
  - 'To arrive at this number we must systematically follow a procedure according
    to the information available. This process must be iterative. One of the ways
    to solve it is to subdivide the problem and first try to discover the digits
    and then the correct order.  In terms of computational thinking it means that
    we have to pass 4 steps:   Step 1: Decomposition To solve the problem, we need
    to break it down into smaller parts. We need to analyze each guess and its response
    to narrow down the possible values for each digit in the password.  Step 2: Pattern
    Recognition We need to look for patterns in the guesses and responses. For example,
    in the first guess, one digit is in the right position, which means that the
    corresponding digit in the password must be one of the digits in the guess. We
    also know that the password consists of four distinct digits.  Step 3: Abstraction
    We need to abstract the information we have gathered and keep track of the possible
    values for each digit in the password based on the responses given.  Let''s abstract
    the idea of solution. General steps of abstraction can be noted as follows: 
    - The problem can be abstracted as a guessing game with limited feedback. - The
    goal is to use the feedback to eliminate incorrect possibilities and gradually
    narrow down the search space. - The problem involves finding a combination of
    four distinct digits that satisfy certain conditions. - We need to create a table
    to keep track of the possible values for each digit in the password based on
    the responses given by the computer. - The last step is iterative: we need to
    compare information in each row finding a combination of four distinct digits
    that satisfy certain conditions.  Step 4: Algorithm design Based on the information
    in the table, we can narrow down the possible values for each digit in the password.
    We can start by looking at the digits that appear in multiple guesses and try
    to deduce their position in the password in a couple of iterations.   Detailed
    steps of algorithm at work are:   From the first row (guess plus response) we
    know that only one of the given digits is part of the password. The second and
    third rows provide similar information.  The fourth row then helps to extract
    more information from rows one to three: We can discard 5 from the first guess,
    6 from the second guess, and 1 and 5 from the third guess. From this last step
    we know that 4 and 8 are parts of the password. Then the correct digit in the
    fifth guess is 8; from that we can conclude from row five that 1, 2 and 5 are
    not parts of the password.  If we go back to rows one and two, the possibly correct
    numbers are 7 or 0 in row one, and 3 or 0 in row two. Thus, we have 5 possible
    numbers 0,3,4,7 and 8. If 0 was in the password, then both 7 and 3 would need
    to be discarded given that only one number is correct for rows one and two. This
    would leave only 0,4,8 as possible numbers in the password. Given that the password
    must contain four unique numbers, 0 cannot be correct. Therefore, the other digits
    that complete the code must be 3 and 7. Now we consider the information of the
    position or order. From rows three and five, we know that 8 can be in positions
    2 or 4:  ?-8-?-8 and that 4 can be in all positions but 2: 4-?-4-4 From row one
    we know that 7 must be in position 2; then, 8 must be in position 4. From row
    two we know that 3 cannot be in position 3, so that it must be in position 1.
    Hence, 4 is in position 3. This gives the only possible option for the password
    which is: 3-7-4-8'
